Process Our app was started with the Django framework to get a nice initial outline of where all our components would go. Then, we began attempting to connect the Google Places API to a location. Next we created successful user registration and login with authentication. Once we were able to list nearby beaches based on a user's location, we planned out the data models we would need in order to link signed-in users to a specific beach; this link was created based on the user's posts on that beach's page.
